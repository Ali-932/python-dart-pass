#Q:Write a program that takes an Integer (0 < x <= 10) then takes X integers one
#after another, after inputting all those numbers, you should print 'N is odd' or 'N
#is even' depending on each N that was received. Your whole program should be
#implemented using a single function.
print("please enter a value from 1 to 10")
checker=False
while(checker==False):
    x=int (input())

    if(x>=0 and x <=10):
        checker=True
    else:
        print("enter a value from 1 to 10 only!!")
    print("please enter ", x ," values")

for i in range (x) :
    y=int(input())
    if(y%2==0):
        print(y," is even")
    else:
        print(y," is odd")
